Challenge #1

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

--------------------------3 Tier env----------------------------------
Three tier Env setup:
We need to create below resources in Azure to setup three tier env. We can use Terraform for below infrastructure provisioning. Create terraform files for below resources.

-resource group with region
-vnet
-3 subnet(web,app,db with ip range)
-3 nsg(web,app,db)
-route table(web,app,db)
-VM Public IP,
-NIC
-VM, VM os disk

Also create separate terraform files for Provider and variables.


Design Azure pipelines in ADO for below terraform actions:
terraform installer -->To install terraform
terraform init --> intialization of the working directory which consists of all configuration files
terraform fmt--> ensure formatting is correct, if required it will format it in proper structure.
terraform validate--> to ensure no syntax errors are there
terraform plan --> to create an execution plan to reach a desired state, if required changes can be made in the configuration files to achieve desired state
terraform apply--> it will make changes in the infrastructure as defined in the plan, and infrastrucure will be in desired state.

In order to clean up infrastructure, need to use Terrfaorm destroy action.
